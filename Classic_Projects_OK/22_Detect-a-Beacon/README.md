### Project #22: Detect-a-Beacon
Learn to find and range iBeacons using our first project for a physical device.
1- Techniques:
[] - Core Location
[] - Location permissions and it's tricky privacy properties
[] - detecting beacon with a method

2- Step-by-step:
Read through this tutorial, since I can't build it in two devices to test. It's pretty straight-forward a way of generating beacons and reading it's input. Copied Paul Hudson's template into the folder, in case I need to build something related to it in the future.

3- Challenges:
Challenges are related to animating and creating alerts to this app when the results change, which are not beacon-related.
