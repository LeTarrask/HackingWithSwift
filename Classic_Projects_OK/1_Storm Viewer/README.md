### Project #1: Storm Viewer
Get started coding in Swift by making an image viewer app and learning key concepts.

1- Techniques:
[] - FileManager
[] - UIViewController

2- Step-by-step:
We create a TableViewController, connect it to a tableview in storyboard, create a DetailViewController and also connect it to storyboard, and automatically create the method that links the two of them. It was a mix of a revival of old tutorials past, and also a wake-up call of how easier SwiftUI is.

3- Challenges:
Use Interface Builder to select the text label inside your table view cell and adjust its font size to something larger (did by changing it in storyboard inspector); In your main table view, show the image names in sorted order, so “nssl0033.jpg” comes before “nssl0034.jpg” (did it by calling sort() in the pictures array just in the end of viewDidLoad method); Rather than show image names in the detail title bar, show “Picture X of Y” (passed it as a string to detail view).
