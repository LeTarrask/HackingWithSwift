### Project #18: Debugging
Everyone hits problems sooner or later, so learning to find and fix them is an important skill.
1- Techniques:
[] - XCode Use
[] - assert
[] - break points and how to customize and analise them

2- Step-by-step:
This project is just about to see the debugging tools we have in XCode. Stuff I'm not currently using too much: assert inside my code (don't worry, this doesn't go to production code, just in XCode debugging), and break points to see WTF is wrong with the code I write.

3- Challenges:
The challenges are to use the techniques: add an exception breakpoint into project 1, adding an assert in project 1 as well, and add a conditional breakpoint if the user does something wrong. These challenges don't change final code output though, so won't be commited.
