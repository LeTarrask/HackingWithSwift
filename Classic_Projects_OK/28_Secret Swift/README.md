### Project #28: Secret Swift
Save user data securely using the device keychain and Touch ID.
1- Techniques:
[] - iOS Keychain
[] - Hide and show views in UIKit
[] - Code for keyboard resign first responder

2- Step-by-step:
Added a textview, then a few methods to hide and show it, according to user authentication using LocalAuthentication.

3- Challenges:
Done button as a navigation bar item that causes the app to re-lock immediately rather than waiting for the user to quit; Create a password system for your app so that the Touch ID/Face ID fallback is more useful (can be something interesting to be reused); Go back to project 10 (Names to Faces) and add biometric authentication so the userâ€™s pictures are shown only when they have unlocked the app (this too).
