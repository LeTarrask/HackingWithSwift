### Project #2: Guess the flag
**There's a SwiftUI version - can skip**
Make a game using UIKit, and learn about integers, buttons, colors and actions.
1- Techniques:
[] - asset catalogs
[] - buttons, layers actions, random numbers, alerts

2- Step-by-step:
A simple project where we create 3 buttons with storyboard and add a simple game logic. It's simpler than SwiftUI, but SwiftUI's result is more complex.

3- Challenges:
Try showing the player’s score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess. (did a string interpolation into the title); Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert controller after they have answered 10. This should show their final score. (added a resetGame method, and a questions counter); When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message –
something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example (added a message string, just like the title, that gets the correct value and capitalizes it.)
