### Project #31: MultiBrowser
Get started with UIStackView and see just how easy iPad multitasking is.
1- Techniques:
[] - UIStackView
[] - App Transport Security (Apple prevents loading sites that aren't https)
[] - Handling iPad multitasking with other screens.
[] - iPad size classes

2- Step-by-step:
Create an iPad project, set the view in storyboard, add some navbuttons, added webviews inside the UIStackView, delegate to control it, and then use iPad size classes to adjust the view sizes whenever it updates.

3- Challenges:
Test if user typed address has https as a prefix, if not, try to convert it to URL; add a descriptive label.
