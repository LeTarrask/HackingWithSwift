### Project #38: GitHub Commits
Get started with Core Data by building an app to fetch and store GitHub commits for Swift.
1- Techniques:
[] - Core Data
[] - SwiftyJSON package, to decode JSON (now it's simpler to use more recent codable stuff, I'd guess)

2- Step-by-step:
We load a JSON and use SwiftyJSON framework to decode it (now I'd rather use Codable, but anyways), and then build a complex Core Data project. It's tricky.

3- Challenges:
Challenges are to go deep into Core Data as well. Actually, he suggests to study more. Will do that with Donny Wals' book, and probably finish Dualogue.
