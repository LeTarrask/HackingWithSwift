2- Step-by-step:

3- Challenges:
Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely (It's just a matter of adding the string to the array); Add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app (it's just a matter of repeating the tutorial); Add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped (this challenge is also a practice one).
