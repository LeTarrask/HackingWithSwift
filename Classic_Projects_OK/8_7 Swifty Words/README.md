### Project #8: 7 Swifty Words
Build a word-guessing game and master strings once and for all.
1- Techniques:
[] - UIKit programmatically
[] - Build a view without storyboard (it's a pain)
[] - property observers: didSet
[] - addTarget()
[] - enumerated(), joined(), replacingOccurrences() and other String methods.

2- Step-by-step:
A lot of pages to build one single view (still missing SwiftUI, will do forever, I guess). Code is kind of complicated, because it's a game, but has several nice string editing tricks.

3- Challenges:
draw a thin gray line around the buttons view (with code from project 2); If the user enters an incorrect guess, show an alert telling them they are wrong (also simple, with code from previous project); deduct points for wrong answers and update the level up rules.
