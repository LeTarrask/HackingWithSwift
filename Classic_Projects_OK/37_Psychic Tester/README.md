### Project #37: Psychic Tester
Are you psychic? Of course not. But what if we could use our coding skills to make a game to fool your friends into thinking otherwise?
1- Techniques:
[] - Watch app
[] - Storyboard
[] - CAEmmiterLayer
[] - IBDesignable, IBInspectable

2- Step-by-step:
We create a bunch of cards as subviews of a view, add a subclass of view to hold a GradientView, add audio capabilities, then start the fun stuff: adding 3D touch recognition, Apple Watch connectivity, create a watch app using storyboard, and present an instructions screen when we load the app.

3- Challenges:
The challenges here are to run the app and make the gimmicks for it to be fun. No Apple Watch to test, though, and I'd guess making the app in SwiftUI would be a little easier.
