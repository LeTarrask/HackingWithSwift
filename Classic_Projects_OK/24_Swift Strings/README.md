### Project #24: Swift Strings
Dive deep into how strings work in Swift, and learn how to add formatting on top.
1- Techniques:
[] - NSAttributedString and it's properties.

2- Step-by-step:
This is not a project, but a playground where we do some experimentation with NSAttributedString methods, and a few String ones, such as isEmpty, and adding extensions to remove prefixes and suffixes.

3- Challenges:
Create a String extension that adds a withPrefix() method. If the string already contains the prefix it should return itself; if it doesnâ€™t contain the prefix, it should return itself with the prefix added; Create a String extension that adds an isNumeric property that returns true if the string holds any sort of number; Create a String extension that adds a lines property that returns an array of all the lines in a string.
