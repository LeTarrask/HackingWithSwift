### Project #12: UserDefaults
Learn how to save user settings and data for later use.
1- Techniques:
[] - NSCoding
[] - Codable
[] - UserDefaults

2- Step-by-step:
We save the data from project 10 using NSCoding, and store it in UserDefaults. After that, we do the same thing, but instead turning the Model into a Codable, which is quite easier, because we don't have to explain to it how to do its job.

3- Challenges:
The challenges are to apply this knowledge int old projects. Project 1 so that it remembers how many times each storm image was shown; Project 2 so that it saves the player’s highest score (could do it, but would deprecate the game over situation); Project 5 so that it saves the current word and all the player’s entries to UserDefalts.
