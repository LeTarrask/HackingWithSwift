### Project #39: Unit testing with XCTest
Learn how to write unit tests and user interface tests using Xcode's built-in testing framework.

1- Techniques:
[] - XCTest
[] - filter, sort, map functions used for the first time, I'd guess
[] - measure {} in testing is very interesting.
[] - encapsulation of the filtering function is pretty interesting
[] - recording a UI test

2- Step-by-step:
We create a simple app that loads a list of words, and test its speed, and a few functions, to see if it works. The cool part is the functional programming that is presented for the first time here.

3- Challenges:
The challenges are to review other stuff to test, and implement them in apps.
