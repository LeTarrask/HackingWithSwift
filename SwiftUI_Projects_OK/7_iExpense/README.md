### Project #7: iExpense
Bring in a second view with this expense tracking app
1- Techniques:
[] - multiple screens, load and save user data, more complex user interfaces
[] - @ObservedObject property wrapper
[] - Presenting views with modal sheets
[] - using OnDelete
[] - UserDefaults
[] - Archiving objects with Codable

2- Step-by-step:
Pretty similar to some aspects of Mileage Tracker, and some solutions I found there, but a very barebones version of it.

3- Challenges:
add edit/done button to contentview, modify each expense layout according to value, add validation to addview, showing alert if wrong input
