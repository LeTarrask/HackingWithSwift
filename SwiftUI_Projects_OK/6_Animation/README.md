### Project #6: Animation
Spruce up your UI with springs, bounces, and more
1- Techniques:
[] - scaleEffect, blur, easeOut, .interpolatingSpring(stiffness: 50, damping: 1)
[] -
[]

2- Step-by-step:
There are a lot of animation parameters explained in this chapter. It's a mix between documentation and testing. For example, this:
.animation(Animation.easeInOut(duration: 2).repeatCount(3, autoreverses: true))
rotation3DEffect()
Created different views with all the animation exercises

3- Challenges:
In the Guess the Flag project, tap the correct flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis; make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity; tap on the wrong flag (personally, I chose to make the background show a red rectangle.)
