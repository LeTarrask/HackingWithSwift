### Project #8: Moonshot
Teach users about space history with scroll views, Codable, and more
1- Techniques:
[] - Geometry Reader
[] - ScrollView to work with scrolling Data
[] - NavigationLink
[] - Hierarchical Codable Data
[] - Loading Specific Codable Data

2- Step-by-step:
Decode the provided jsons and images to show them in an organized, structured way.

3- Challenges:
Add mission date to one view (trivial), Modify AstronautView to show all the missions this astronaut flew on (got super struck and had to ask for help), Make a bar button in ContentView that toggles between showing launch dates and showing
crew names (it was supposed to be hard, and found it kinda simple.)
